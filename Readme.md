## Demo Application
This is a demonstration application that can be used for practicing skills or trying out something new.  Some ideas are listed below for activities that could be attempted using the application.

- There is a runtime bug that prevents the BMW models from being displayed.  See if you can address this.
- The Quote system is quite basic.  Introduce the date of birth in to the calculation so that people under the age of 17 and over the age of 80 can not receive a quote.  As part of doing this consider refactoring the code to make it easier to extend in the future.  Also introduce some further unit testing to support the changed that have been made.
- The user interface is quite simple.  Make changes to the user interface to improve the user experience.  This could take the form of making the appearance more apealing or improving the validation code including adding  support for the date of birth changes that were carried out in the previous step.  The unit tests could also be reviewed and added to.
- Make changes to store quotes for later retrieval.
